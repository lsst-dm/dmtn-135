{fast -- NVME (50GB/ s each) Cost for TB  }&{1000}&{for each TB with file system servers too DDN NVME box with GPFS servers.
TOP performer with best price also. }&&& \\ \hline
{normal - SATA GPFS file systems/ TB  }&{135}&{for each TB with file system disks and servers locally attached to production resources.   }&&& \\ \hline
{latency -- slower but on disk }&{100}&{only at NCSA: for each TB with file systems and all people/ services. 
The complete service not usually attached.   S3 bucket type.  
Can be mounted if needed but not for production worthy speeds. }&&& \\ \hline
{high latency -- very slow -- on tape }&{64}&{only at NCSA: for each TB with file systems and all people/ services. 
The complete service with data flowing to tape using policies. }&&& \\ \hline
