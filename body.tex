\section{ Models}\label{sec:model}
\subsection{Sizing model}\label{sec:sizemodel}

An exhaustive and detailed mode is provided in  \citedsp{LDM-138,LDM-144} - here we concentrate on the needs for the
final years of construction. We explore the compute and storage needed to get us through commissioning and suggest a 2023 purchase for DR1,2 processing which could be pushed to operations.

\tabref{tab:Inputs} gives the annual requirements for the next few years.

\input{Inputs}

\subsection{Compute and storage }\label{sec:csmodel}
We which to base our budget on reasonable well know machines for which we have well know prices.
\tabref{tab:Machines} gives an outline of a few standard machines we use and a price. This table also gives a FLOP estimate
for those machines.
\tabref{tab:Storage} gives costs for different types of storage - we will require various latency for different tasks
and those have varying costs.
These tables are used as look ups for the cost models in \secref{sec:cost}

\section{Proposed budget}\label{sec:cost}
Based on the needs in \tabref{tab:Inputs} and the costs in \tabref{tab:Storage} and \tabref {tab:Machines}
the following budgets can be considered.
