\section{Operations budget estimate}\label{sec:opscost}
Based on the needs in \tabref{tab:opsInputs} and the costs in \tabref{tab:opsStorageCost} and \tabref {tab:Machines}
we get the estimate presented in \tabref{tab:opsSummary}

\input{opsSummary}

Again in \tabref{tab:opsSummary} we assume IN2P3 do 50\% of processing.
We have applied a compunded modest cost reduction assuming that processors  and disks get a little cheaper - that
percentage is given in \tabref{tab:Inputs}.

More details are in \secref{sec:opsdetails}
