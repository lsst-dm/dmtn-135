\section{Pre -Operations budget estimate}\label{sec:opscost}
In this section we estimate the ramp up of the USDF to be ready for start of operations.
This means having compute for commissioning data as well as developer services and a small science platform in place.
It is very similar to the construction needs. The summary is in \tabref{tab:preOps}.

\input{preOps}

Currently we assume exactly the construction profile for storage plus space for datasets currently held at NCSA.
This is presented in \tabref{tab:preStorage}.

The compute is a little different and uses Rome
which is captured in \tabref{tab:preCompute}.

\input{preCompute}
