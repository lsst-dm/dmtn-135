\tabref{tab:opsXeon} gives the price of compute based on Xeons.

\tabref{tab:opsStorageCost} gives the price of storage using all  types that we need.
This would be needed regardless of the compute chosen.
\input{opsXeon}
\input{opsStorageCost}

\tabref{tab:overheadCost} gives the annual cost of hosting compute. This includes purchasing racks to house
new nodes etc.
\input{opsOverheadCost}

Various other inputs to ops costing are given in \tabref{tab:opsInputs}.
