\subsection{Ops Cost details}\label{sec:opsdetails}
\tabref{tab:opsXeon} gives the price of compute based on Xeons.
This is broken down further for US in \tabref{tab:opsXeonUSDF} and Chile in \tabref{tab:opsXeonChile}.
However the Ops costing for SLAC was done using \tabref{tab:opsRomeUSDF}.

\tabref{tab:opsStorageCost} gives the price of storage using all  types that we need.
This is broken down further for US in \tabref{tab:opsStorageUSDF} and Chile in \tabref{tab:opsStorageChile}
This would be needed regardless of the compute chosen.

\tabref{tab:overheadCost} gives the annual cost of hosting compute. This includes purchasing racks to house
new nodes etc.

Various other inputs to ops costing are given in \tabref{tab:opsInputs}.
